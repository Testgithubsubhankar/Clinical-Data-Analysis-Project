# Clinical-Data-Analysis-Project
A high-volume clinical data analytics project where I worked with over 20 million rows of clinical data using SQL Server and Power BI.

---


üîç **Challenges & Solutions**:
Due to the massive data volume, importing directly into Power BI wasn't efficient. So, I architected the solution with a **data lake and data warehouse layer in SQL Server**. All major **data cleaning, transformation, and modeling tasks** were executed at the SQL level, ensuring performance and scalability.

üìä **Advanced Data Profiling**:
Using **dynamic SQL**, I developed a profiling process to calculate:

* Mean, Median, Mode
* Standard Deviation, Min/Max
* Null count, Distinct count, Zero values
* Column-wise frequency distribution

These insights were essential to understand the underlying structure and behavior of the dataset.

üõ† **Modeling & Transformation**:

* Normalized date ranges between 2024‚Äì2030 using **T-SQL**
* Performed **feature selection** to optimize datasets for reporting
* Connected refined tables to **Power BI** for visual insights

üìà **Power BI Insights & Optimization**:
Built KPIs to track metrics such as:

* Number of infections
* Readmissions
* Admissions
* Deaths by hospital and over time

Enabled **incremental data refresh** for efficient report updates and **migrated the data pipeline** from SQL Server to MySQL without affecting Power BI reports. Also set up **multiple workspaces** in Power BI for better data governance.
